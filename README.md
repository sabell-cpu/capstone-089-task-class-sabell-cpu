# 089 Task Class

the task board
- should use a `Task` class with two constructor parameters of description and status to create new objects for each task in the tasks array
- should display the same before and after each `task` is encapsulated in objects

Building toward CSTA Standards:
- Develop programs for multiple computing platforms. (3B-AP-19) https://www.csteachers.org/page/standards
- Construct solutions to problems using student-created components, such as procedures, modules and/or objects. (3B-AP-14) https://www.csteachers.org/page/standards
- Use lists to simplify solutions, generalizing computational problems instead of repeatedly using simple variables. (3A-AP-14) https://www.csteachers.org/page/standards
